# Find And Seek - The mobile companion to the python passion project

Find And Seek is originally a Python passion project completed to gain competency in Python and object oriented design and development. It brings together a passion for retail- specifically luxury retail- and technology. Now it's getting even more fullstack treatment with a mobile app.
